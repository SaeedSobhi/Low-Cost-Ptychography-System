# Low-Cost-Ptychography-System

As a part of the Open UC2 project https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-REST in IPHT Leibniz Institute, Jena, Bio Nanoimaging Group https://nanoimaging.de/team/ 

This academic project shows how to build a low cost Ptychograhpy system using 3d printed cubes to build the system body, Laser diode as illumination system, Stepper Motor to move the sample and an additional optical system conssiting of LEDs grid _ Objective Lens _ ESP32 Camera working as positioning system. 

Please check the atatched report of the project for more details.
